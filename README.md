# Final Year Project - IndoorGuide 
In the recent years, positioning and navigation systems such as Google Maps have accomplished significant achievements in making life easy of the users specially in outdoor environments. A wide-scale spread of smart phones and other wireless devices are leading to the development of a variety of services, including indoor localization. However,
positioning and navigating in an indoor environment has its own unique challenges and problems because of the specific complexities and diversities of an indoor environment
like in a supermarket. In this project, the answer to the question,**”Can we develop a precise indoor localization system for a supermarket where we can give the list of the grocery items and the system will guide us just like Google Maps?”** is explored.

IndoorGuide project will mainly focus on developing an accurate indoor positioning solution which has an accuracy less than 1 m. The indoor positioning system will be robust
for any sensor failure or faulty readings. The system is to be tested in an indoor environment with dynamic obstacles and situations. The outcome will be integrated with an inventory management system where the users can get valuable information such as stock availability, advertisements,discounts and ongoing offers when they are using the indoor positioning system to find items in the environment.
